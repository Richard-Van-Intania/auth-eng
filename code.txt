    // let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
    //     .max_connections(80)
    //     .connect(DB_URL)
    //     .await
    //     .expect("Failed to connect to database");


    TL;DR: Best practice for RESTful API design is that path params are used to identify a specific resource or resources, while query parameters are used to sort/filter those resources.

axum allows you to add middleware just about anywhere

To entire routers with Router::layer and Router::route_layer.
To method routers with MethodRouter::layer and MethodRouter::route_layer.
To individual handlers with Handler::layer.

How to make state available to middleware depends on how the middleware is written.
